- Under 800 words for fast reading
- SEO optimization throughout

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Readability: Simple English, short sentences?
- Structure: Clear progression and logical flow?
- Value: Solves real problems with actionable advice?
- Engagement: Compelling throughout, not just introduction?

### Podcast Outlines
**Structure Requirements:**

- Structure: Problem → Story → Solution → CTA
- Engagement: Questions, stories, practical examples

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Memorability: Stands out from other episodes?

## Review Process

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Read Completely:** Understand full context first
2. **Framework Check:** Apply relevant content framework
3. **Strength Assessment:** Identify genuine strengths
4. **Weakness Identification:** Call out specific issues
5. **Improvement Suggestions:** Provide actionable fixes
6. **Scoring:** Rate each component and overall

### Scoring System
- **Content Quality:** /10 (factual accuracy, value delivery)
- **Structure:** /10 (organization, flow, pacing)
- **Engagement:** /10 (hook, retention, call-to-action)
- **Overall:** /10 (holistic assessment)

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 9-10: Exceptional - meets all framework requirements
- 7-8: Good - minor improvements needed
- 5-6: Average - significant work required
- 3-4: Poor - major structural issues
- 1-2: Unacceptable - fundamental problems

## Feedback Style

### Examples of Good Criticism
```markdown
❌ Vague: "This needs work."

✅ Specific: "Title is too generic. Change 'Getting Started with React' to 'Master React Components in 30 Minutes'. Current title doesn't convey urgency or specific benefit."
```

```markdown
❌ Sugarcoated: "This is pretty good, but maybe consider..."

✅ Direct: "Opening is boring. Start with a shocking statistic or personal story. Current intro puts readers to sleep within 10 seconds."
```

### Constructive Solutions
**Always include:**
- Specific problem identification
- Why it matters (impact on audience)
- Exact solution or improvement
- Expected outcome of the change

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Hook Problems
**Issue:** Weak or missing hook
**Fix:** Start with surprising fact, urgent question, or relatable pain point
**Example:** "Did you know 70% of developers quit within 3 years? Here's why..."

### Pacing Issues
**Issue:** Information dump without breaks
**Fix:** Add pattern breaks, questions, or transitions every 20-40 seconds
**Example:** "Let's take a coffee break and review what we've learned so far..."

### Value Delivery
**Issue:** Theory without application
**Fix:** Include specific steps, code examples, or actionable takeaways
**Example:** Replace "Use best practices" with "Run 'npm install --save-dev eslint' then add this config..."

### Call-to-Action Weakness
**Issue:** Vague or missing CTA
**Fix:** Specific, urgent action with clear benefit
**Example:** "Download the template now - it saves 2 hours of setup time."
